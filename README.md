# FoxBot
Discord bot for Ragnarok Online Mobile guild Fox build in TypeScript

# Installation
In the root directory, use "npm install". The bot will not work without a secret token. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and create a bot. Then go to the bot page and copy the secret token.
Create a file called secret.json in the src folder and insert the following. Be sure to replace Bot secret token here with your actual token.
{
  "BOT_SECRET_TOKEN": "Bot secret token here"
}

# Running
In the root directly, use "npm run start" and it will start the bot on whichever server you authorized it on.
